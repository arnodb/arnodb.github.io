Hello, my name is Arnaud de Bossoreille and I like technology especially when it works and when it
has a purpose!

You may find here and on my GitHub account some of the work I want to share. Enjoy!

Want to hire me? [My resume](/resume) may be of some interest to you.

Want to have a break? A few suggestions (to my taste):

* read [Vol de nuit](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vol_de_nuit) (Night Flight)
* listen to [The Kills](https://thekills.tv/), an electric guitar band, they play electric guitar music
* read one of the [Patrick Modiano](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Modiano) books (I read 30 of them and liked a majority of those)
* listen to [Ludovico Einaudi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludovico_Einaudi), or even better: go to a concert (Federico Mecozzi and Redi Hasa are also awesome)!
* read [Voyage avec un âne dans les Cévennes](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyage_avec_un_%C3%A2ne_dans_les_C%C3%A9vennes) (Travels with a Donkey in the Cévennes)
