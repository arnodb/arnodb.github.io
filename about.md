Hello, my name is Arnaud de Bossoreille and I like technology especially when it works and when it
has a purpose! Who is that little fellow with a yellow face, eating dots, and pursued by ghosts?

You may find here and on my GitHub account some of the work I want to share. Enjoy!

Willing to have a break? My personal suggestion is to read *Le Lys dans la vall√©e* (*The Lily of the
Valley* for my English speaking friends), available in all good book shops.
